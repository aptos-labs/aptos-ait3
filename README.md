# Public Fullnode instruction

Hey all, thank you for interested in running a fullnode on AIT3! Please follow the instructions to:

1. Setup you fullnode following the [same instruction](https://aptos.dev/nodes/full-node/fullnode-for-devnet) as running fullnode on devnet, use the `testnet` branch and `testnet` docker image tag instead of the devnet one. 
2. Replace the genesis.blob and waypoint from the above instruction to the files hosted in this repo.
3. Make sure you start your fullnode with static identity, this is required for getting the fullnode reward. See instruction [here](https://aptos.dev/nodes/full-node/network-identity-fullnode)

- The docker image tag to use is `testnet_b2228f286b5fe7631dee62690ae5d1087017e20d`
- Sha256 for the docker image is `050b644b13cf74a02edfeed3b2416baf269b65f068198a4e10cfa4e58c1b9b0a`
